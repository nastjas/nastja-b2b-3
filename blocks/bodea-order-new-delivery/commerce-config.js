Cart custom attributes need API-level GraphQL support in the target Commerce environment.
They do not need pre-created Admin EAV attributes just to be sent through setCustomAttributesOnCart.
Separate backend or integration work may still be needed if these values must be visible in Admin,
indexed, exported, validated, or consumed by downstream operational workflows after order placement.
